# LiveCity

## Summary
As cities grow, spaces become tighter. 

We have an opportunity to be more efficient with the use of these spaces based on their availability outside of operating hours. 

As residential spaces get smaller, the need for activity spaces outside the home gets bigger.

## Full description

### Problem

We are urban inhabitants.
We are disconnected from each other.
We are unaware of the urban services and opportunities that might exist.
We want to fully leverage the spaces of the city.


### Opportunity 

We want to create linkages in the following ways:
* Person to Person
* Person to Business / Organization
* Business to Business / Organization
We want to educate the public as to the potentials present in our city.
We want to unlock the spatial potentials in cities to allow for a more complete utilization of our built assets over time.

### Strategy (Part 1)

Aggregate user and population data to show occupation of the city over the course of any given day.
Map anonymized user data to show intensity over the course of the day.
Map business and public spaces in the city on top of activity data.
Code spaces with operational hours and contact information.
Allow people to search either open business and/or available spaces.

### Strategy (Part 2)

Create platform on which businesses can offer available spaces that can be occupied by the community during non-operational hours.
Tie in database of space characteristics and restrictions
Logins for both businesses/organizations and users.
Reputation system for both businesses and users.
Broker transactions for businesses.

### Strategy (Part 3)

 Create social profiles for individuals to allow for controlled communications between users.
Leverage existing social networks.


### Approach

Create a beautiful web portal to help educate the public about the possibilities.
